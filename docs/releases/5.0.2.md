# Version 5.0.2
15 April 2022

## Announcement
Added new convenience method.

## Changes
- Added convenience method `FLConfiguration>>onStream:`. This method allows `FLSerializer` and `FLMaterializer` instances
to be reused, even when setting a new stream on every invocation (this wasn't possible with `#streamFactory:`).
