# Version 1.4
1 June 2011

Opening our News section, this post announces a new release version in ConfigurationOfFuel. It is the 1.4 and includes this list of changes:

- Serialization in memory.
- Important refactorings done in various hierarchies and protocols.
- Hack to avoid several OrderedCollection >> makeRoomAtLast during deserialization.
- Small code cleanups.

To expand on the topic of serialization in memory, I give an example:
```smalltalk
 aByteArray := FLSerializer serializeInMemory: sourceObject.
 ```

And then:
```smalltalk
loadedObject := FLMaterializer materializeFromByteArray: aByteArray.
```

The idea is to provide protocol for NoSQL databases, where the graph is stored as a blob and not on a stream.
