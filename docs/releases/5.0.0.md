# Version 5.0.0
27 February 2022

## Announcement
Although release 5.0.0 includes only one change, but introduces a
change in the serialization format.

## Changes
- Added full support for stateful traits (aka "TraitsV2" in Pharo). 

## Notes
Stateful traits have instance variables that are applied to the target class. To support this, Fuel needs to serialize additional information about traits.
	
Stateful traits are available in Pharo only, starting at version 8.

Only users that previously have experimented with [Talents](https://github.com/tesonep/pharo-talents) or serialization of anonymous classes will see a difference. However, if you've used Fuel to serialize traits, you will need migrate your snapshots (additional information is stored for all traits, not
just for stateful ones).
