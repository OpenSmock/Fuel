# Version 1.9
17 February 2014

## Changes:

- (feature) the #fuelReplacement selector offers the ability to statically replace an object (e.g. with nil) during analysis. This can lead to significantly smaller graphs and improved speed when serializing large graphs
- (feature) serialize the same graph that was analyzed instead of retrazing the graph during serialization. This prevents changes in the graph from happening between analysis and serialization
- (change) store source when serializing CompiledMethod objects. Needed because Opal does not allow decompilation
- (fix) migrate variables across hierarchy
- (feature) Object>>serializeToFileNamed: shortcut for serializing arbitrary objects
- (fix) better compression for LargeNegativeIntegers (https://pharo.fogbugz.com/f/cases/12052/Fuel-could-store-LargeNegativeInteger-up-to-32bits-magnitude)
