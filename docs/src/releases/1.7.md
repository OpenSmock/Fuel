# Version 1.7
14 October 2011

We have released the new version 1.7 of Fuel. The list of changes includes performance optimizations, design clean-ups, and new features.

- The FLSerializer and FLMaterializer API has changed. They are no longer implementing the algorithms but are a kind of Fa√ßade.
- Developer guides with examples: Getting Started and Customizing the graph.
- Serialization substitutions: "Store this object instead of me."
- Global sends: "Restore me by sending this selector to this global"
- Versioning the stream: We prefix the stream with a version number that should match when loading.
- Performance optimizations on instances of:
- Word-like classes. (We thank a lot to Henrik Sperre Johansen for your help!)
- ByteString and Symbol.
- Date, Time, Duration and DateAndTime.
- Point and Rectangle.
- MethodDictionary. Now materialization is 2000x faster, thanks to its new rehash without become.
- Huge clean-up in Tests package.
