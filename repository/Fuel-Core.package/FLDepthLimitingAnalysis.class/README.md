I am a specialized analysis that limits the depth of the serialized graph to a configured number.

I know how the degree of the node being analyzed and the configured limit. Whenever the degree of the analyzed node exceeds the limit I will ignore the current node and continue with the next node.

I am used by FLSerialization to build the graph of objects to serialize.
